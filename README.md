# StockEarningsUS

## Subjective
1. Find all the stocks that are reporting earnings the next day (Market cap > 10 mil)
2. Analyze to see if they are undervalued/overvalued and oversold/overbought
3. Decide whether to long or short
4. Close position shortly after the market opens the next day
5. $$$ Big Gains $$$

## Why
The reason that this project comes to my mind is that stock price usually fluctuates dramatically after the earnings report, which is perfect for swing traders like me! 
The theory behind that is the latest earning shows how the company has actually been doing and the stock price is just what people think it's valued. Often times, stock prices rise or fall by more than 10% because the difference between expectation and the real world is just too big.

## My observation
There are 4 scenarios
1. Stock price rises after earning beat
2. Stock price falls after earning beat
3. Stock price falls after earning lose
4. Stock price rises after earning lose

## What
1. Look at the companies reporting earning the next morning or tonight
2. Choose 1 ~ 4 companies with the largest capital
3. Analyze them

## How
1. See the past earnings of this company and how the price reacts the next day
2. Identify pressure and support to find oppotunity of gains
3. Look through news and realize public opinion
4. Observe recent long/short on this stock by mainn forces
5. Basic Technical analysis (EMA, MACD, RSI, Volume)
6. Basic Fundemental anlaysis (Revenue, net profit, cash flow, debt)
7. Percieve its insintric value
8. Discover its competitors and see how they perform
9. Determine the whether the stock has a good future

## When
After analyzing these stocks, look at their current price level
1. If their price level is very high & rating is long, long after the market opens next day
2. If their price level is low & rating is long, long the day before earning
3. If their price level is very low & rating is short, short after the market opens next day
4. If their price is very high & rating is short, short the day before earning


## Key Knowledge
### Insintric Value
The calculation of the intrinsic value formula of the stock is done by dividing the value of the business by the number of outstanding shares of the company
in the market. The value of stock derived in this way is then compared with the market price
of the stock to check if the stock is trading above / at par / below its intrinsic value.
